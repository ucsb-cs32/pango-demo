# pango-demo

Demo of pango library (http://www.pango.org/) 

Creates the png file below.  Original source from: <https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/pango-Cairo-Rendering.html>

In principle, this should compile and link on CSIL (if/when ECI staff do: `yum install cairo cairo-devel pango pango-devel`).  As of right now, 02/06/2018, not yet though.
